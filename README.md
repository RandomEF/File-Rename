# File Renamer

>[!NOTE]
>There are many far better ones out there. This is just one I made for my own personal uses. Feel free to use however if it fits your uses.

This is a program to rename all files matching all the files (given by the fileName variable) in the directory (given by the path variable) into the format given by resultFileName.
